# Code for a spatial interaction model using GRASS GIS to estimate regional exports based on individual firm data

This repository contains code of a regional export estimation model which uses GRASS GIS to implement a doubly-constrained spatial interaction model based on individual firm locations and national input-output tables. The code can be run either on a single CPU or on a single machine with several CPUs. Personally, I ran the full model as a job array of single CPU jobs in a cluster computing environment.

The papers linked to this code are still in review or print. I will add the references as soon as they become available. They should make the code more understandable.
